# STRIPE LANDING PAGE

## DESCRIPTION

This project not only recreates the mockup design with a fully responsive layout across all screen sizes but also provides modular, functional, and easily extendable components to simplify future development.

[**LIVE DEMO**](https://stripe-landing.vercel.app/)

## TECH STACK

- Vite – development and build tool for modern frontend workflows;
- React – component-based library for building dynamic and interactive UIs;
- TypeScript – adds static typing to JS, improving code reliability, readability and refactoring safety;
- Tailwind CSS – utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom, responsive designs within markup;
- SVGR – allows importing and transforming SVGs into React components for easy integration of vector graphics;
- ESLint & Prettier – code formatter and linter that ensures consistent code style across the project.

## HOW TO RUN

Clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## FEATURES

- Responsive Design – page layout adapts seamlessly to screen widths ranging from 320px to 1440px.
- Reusable Components – shared components such as styled buttons (with primary and secondary variants), content and cards containers simplify development and maintain a consistent UI.
- Interactive Elements – buttons, links, and cards include hover animations to enhance user experience.
- Dynamic Calendar – a simple calendar that automatically calculates real dates.
- Adaptive Cards Container – displays only the number of cards that fit within the container width, with optional vertical stacking on mobile devices.
- Centralized Content Management – all content is stored in constants for easy configuration and updates, avoiding hardcoded values within components.
